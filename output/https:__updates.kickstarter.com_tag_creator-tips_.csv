Introducing Pledge Over Time ‚Äî Now Available to all Creators,"Earlier this month, we introduced a suite of new features designed to improve the crowdfunding experience for both creators and backers. ICYMI, here‚Äôs aquick recap of what‚Äôs new. quick recap of what‚Äôs new Today, we‚Äôre unveiling another major improvement:Pledge Over Time, a smarter way to support ambitious projects on Kickstarter. Pledge Over Time Pledge Over Time allows backers to split their pledge into three equal, interest-free monthly payments. That means premium rewards become more accessible, and creators can hit bigger funding goals without changing how they build. Learn More Learn More Why We Built Pledge Over Time The most ambitious ideas deserve to be seen. But as projects evolve from epic board games to cutting-edge hardware so do their funding goals. Higher-tier rewards often require a larger upfront investment, making them harder for backers to commit to in one go. We heard this challenge loud and clear. Some backers held off on pledging altogether. Others paused at checkout, not because they were bored, but because the cost felt out of reach in a single payment. Pledge Over Time is our answer. It removes one of the most significant barriers in crowdfunding, the upfront cost, without adding complexity for creators or requiring interest-bearing loans for backers. Here‚Äôs how it works: For Backers: The first payment is charged when a project successfully funds. The remaining two payments are collected automatically each month.For Creators: After the campaign ends, you receive your standard payout and a payout of the first set of Pledge Over Time payments. Once the remaining Pledge Over Time payments are all collected, you will receive a final payout For Backers: The first payment is charged when a project successfully funds. The remaining two payments are collected automatically each month. For Creators: After the campaign ends, you receive your standard payout and a payout of the first set of Pledge Over Time payments. Once the remaining Pledge Over Time payments are all collected, you will receive a final payout Preview of ""Pledge Over Time"" on the pledge payment page What Creators Are Saying Before rolling it out, we pilotedPledge Over Timewith a select group of beta testers across multiple categories. The feedback? Immediate and enthusiastic. Pledge Over Time ‚ÄúFirst of all, thank you so much for making PLOT available to Kickstarter backers and to my campaign. We‚Äôve received a good number of pledges we would not have otherwise received because of your new payment option.‚Äù ‚ÄîRachel Rener(3X Publishing Creator) Rachel Rener ‚ÄúI would appreciate using it again. It gives more flexibility and can improve the campaign performance, especially for the ones with high reward tiers.‚Äù ‚ÄîDamian Korus(Games Designer of Exploration by Ply) Damian Korus When backers are given more flexibility in how they pledge, especially in ways that fit their lifestyle, they tend to aim higher. During our closed beta, campaigns that offered this payment feature saw average pledge amounts that were 42% higher, and backers who used Pledge Over Time pledged more than double the amount of those who paid upfront. For creators launching ambitious projects, it‚Äôs a simple shift that can lead to big results and make it easier for more backers to take part in bringing those ideas to life. Ready to Reach Higher? Pledge Over Time is live now and built to help you unlock more funds, make premium rewards more accessible, and reduce the friction at checkout. If you‚Äôre ready to give backers more ways to say yes, we‚Äôd love to see what you‚Äôll build. Learn more about Pledge Over Time Learn more about Pledge Over Time",28 May 2025

Shipping & Fulfillment Strategies for Creators Facing Tariff Changes,"As a Kickstarter creator, there is a very good chance you have a multinational supply chain and if that‚Äôs the case, the new U.S. tariffs might hit you hard. In early 2025, the U.S. announced some of the largest changes to trade policy seen in a century.A universal 10% tariffwill soon be going into effect on all imports. Some countries are seeing much higher rates,with China looking at a 145% tariff rateas of the time this post is being written. A universal 10% tariff with China looking at a 145% tariff rate On top of that, the government has alsoremoved thede minimisrulefor imported goods. This rule used to allow small shipments under $800 USD into the U.S. without tariffs. However, it will sunset onMay 2, 2025. removed thede minimisrule Whether you‚Äôre importing a bulk shipment to a U.S. warehouse or sending to individual U.S. backers from overseas, one thing is for sure‚Äîsomeone has to pick up the tariff tab. It might be you, your manufacturer, or your backers. But someone is going to pay the bill. This is already tricky for creators, especially in the games, design, and technology categories. Margins are being squeezed, and timelines are getting pushed back. The hardest part is that the rules are changing fast. In the process oftracking tariffs, we had to edit our work several times in the last two weeks. That is to say, much of the policy and how it will be carried out is in flux. tracking tariffs But that doesn‚Äôt mean all is lost. And it doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs nothing you can do. There are ways to manage the risks associated with tariffs. This is especially true once you consider where you are in your campaign timeline. In this post, we divide creators into three scenarios: Scenario 1:Those who have launched and whose goods are in production or transit.Scenario 2:Those who have launched but haven‚Äôt manufactured yet.Scenario 3:Those who haven‚Äôt launched yet. Scenario 1:Those who have launched and whose goods are in production or transit. Scenario 2:Those who have launched but haven‚Äôt manufactured yet. Scenario 3:Those who haven‚Äôt launched yet. Your next steps will differ depending on where you are. In this post, we‚Äôll give you some key considerations based on your current stage. Scenario 1: You‚Äôve Launched & Goods Are In Production or In Transit This is arguably the most stressful place to be in right now. If you‚Äôve already placed your manufacturing order or signed contracts, then your options are limited. But you can still meaningfully reduce risk even at this point. What‚Äôs the #1 risk? The tariffs hit after you‚Äôve locked in your plans. That means you could be on the hook to pay far more than you expected. If the goods are already moving, you might get a surprise customs bill when they arrive at the port, one which you most likely did not include in your budget. How you can manage U.S. tariffs Here are five things you can do to reduce costs and manage the fallout: Confirm what you‚Äôre actually responsible for.If you‚Äôve already arranged freight shipping, check yourincoterms. This will tell you who is responsible for customs fees. You might be pleasantly surprised to find that your manufacturer is on the hook‚Ä¶not you.Hire a freight forwarder.A good forwarder can help you break down your landed costs‚Äîthe ultimate cost to get your goods delivered to your warehouse. They can also help you with the paperwork, which is especially handyright nowwhen policies are in flux and mistakes can lead to extra fees or delays.Talk to your fulfillment partner.Some fulfillment centers have the experience needed to help creators split shipments or route them through different ports. Sometimes that can help reduce tariff exposure. Either way, it‚Äôs worth asking.Double-check your HTS code.Every cross-border shipment gets a code from theHarmonized Tariff Schedule. This code tells customs what tariff to apply. If your code is wrong, you could end up paying more than you should‚Äîor risk a delay while they sort it out. Your freight forwarder or customs broker can help you get this right.Stay in touch with your backers.Things are changing quickly, and your backers know this. Your timeline might slip and your costs might go up. But luckily, the vast majority of your backers know that it‚Äôs out of your control. So, being open and honest with them will help settle their nerves and give them a reason to trust you.

So, being open and honest with them will help settle their nerves and give them a reason to trust you. Scenario 2: You‚Äôve Launched & Funded, But Haven‚Äôt Started Manufacturing If you‚Äôve launched your project and your project has been successfully funded, but you haven‚Äôt started manufacturing, you‚Äôre in an odd spot. You have other people‚Äôs money in your hands, but you haven‚Äôt made anything yet. And your importing options are far more limited than when you launched your campaign. That means you have to make a ton of decisions. The flipside, of course, is that you at least have some meaningful control. What‚Äôs the #1 risk? The rules could change while you‚Äôre picking a manufacturer. Or worse, you pick one and order, and then a tariff hike hits your category or manufacturer‚Äôs country. You may also need to switch factories at the last minute because of cost or availability. That can throw your whole timeline off. How you can manage U.S. tariffs Here are six things you can do to potentially lower costs and keep your backers relatively comfortable: Be honest with your backers.Backers know the tariffs aren‚Äôt your fault and they know their presence might change how you get the project made. Just be open and honest with them as you make decisions. Straightforward communication makes patience easier.Remember‚Äîwaiting is an option.If things are in flux and you‚Äôre not on a tight deadline, it might be safer to wait for a few weeks. Trying to make big financial commitments in a hurry can push you toward making a mistake.Don‚Äôt try to beat tariffs.You might be tempted to try to rush orders through before new policies take effect. But remember that manufacturing and freight delays are common, especially when large groups of people want to make rush orders at the same time as you. That means even if you try to beat a new tariff deadline, you might end up a couple of weeks behind schedule and paying the tariff anyway.Consider domestic production.Though U.S. manufacturing options may be limited, with the new tariffs, particularly on China, U.S. manufacturing might be priced competitively for your products now. It‚Äôs worth looking at quotes and comparing them to your previous plans.Look beyond China.Other countries‚Äîlike Vietnam, India, Mexico, and some Eastern European nations‚Äîmight offer better trade terms and competitive pricing. You may need to update your files or retool slightly, but it could be worth it.Revisit your campaign plan.If your production costs change, you might need to adjust your reward tiers or stretch goals. If you need to scale back, drop extras, or adjust your shipping timeline, that‚Äôs an option. It‚Äôs better to do this now than fall short later. And again, given how surprising the tariff announcements were, you‚Äôre likely to have a lot of grace from your backers.

And again, given how surprising the tariff announcements were, you‚Äôre likely to have a lot of grace from your backers. Scenario 3: You Haven‚Äôt Launched Yet, But You Want To You have Kickstarter ambitions, but you haven‚Äôt launched anything yet. The tariff announcements might have hurt because they could delay or defer some dreams, but, on balance, this is the best place to be in right now. You‚Äôre not stuck yet and you have options. What‚Äôs the #1 risk? Committing too early or moving forward without considering the tariffs. It‚Äôs tempting to follow your previously laid out plans, but doing so risks being blindsided by cost changes, delays, and new policies. Remember, once you collect backers‚Äô funds, you‚Äôre on the hook and you have to deliver. How you can manage U.S. tariffs Here are six things you can do to manage tariff riskbeforeyou launch: Answer tariff questions before people ask.Mention them in your campaign FAQ, updates, or on the page itself. Tariffs are now the elephant in the room, and it‚Äôs best to address them.Avoid locking in specific shipping prices or dates too early.Don‚Äôt commit to fixed shipping prices or delivery dates if you don‚Äôt have all your manufacturing quotes yet. Use ranges or let people know that final numbers will be confirmed after the campaign through a pledge manager.Use a pledge manager to collect shipping later.If you collect shipping fees after the campaign ends, you can adjust pricing based on the latest tariff rules. It gives you more flexibility and protects you if things shift.Get multiple quotes.Talk to a few different factories and fulfillment centers, both local and international. If something falls through or tariffs change, you have backup plans ready to go.Work with a good customs broker.While it is possible to book your own freight shipping, at this point, given the uncertainty, you should really hire an expert to handle international customs clearance. They can help you calculate tariff costs and plan out shipping.Buffer your costs.Calculate tariffs the best you can, but add another 10-15% to your budget even after that. That gives you a little headroom in case there are more price hikes, port fees, or shipping surprises. Hopefully, you end up not needing it. But if you do, you‚Äôll be glad it‚Äôs there.

Final Thoughts For many creators, the new tariffs are overwhelming. And for those impacted mid-campaign, especially so. If you‚Äôre frustrated, no one could blame you for that at all. But tariffs don‚Äôt have to break your campaign. They do force tough decisions‚Äîand in some cases, uncomfortable conversations with your backers. But even still, there are actions you can take and ways you can adapt. Take a moment to consider where you are now. That will help you figure out the right step to take from there. And if you need help to move forward, don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out to fulfillment centers, freight forwarders, and other industry experts. We‚Äôre all here to help in the best way we know how!

Navigating Tariffs and Shipping Costs: Tips for Kickstarter Creators,"Kickstarter Is Here for You. Our team chats with creators daily, and we know many of you are feeling the pressure right now. Whether you‚Äôre just starting to plan your next campaign or you‚Äôre in the middle of production. Recent changes to U.S. tariffs on imported goods are driving up production costs. If you‚Äôre a creator who depends on overseas manufacturing, small-batch production, or even prototyping internationally, this is more than just a headline. It‚Äôs a very real challenge to your timeline, your budget, and your ability to deliver on your creative vision. At Kickstarter, we see you. And we‚Äôre here to help you navigate this moment. This blog is the first step in an ongoing effort to provide creators with real-time resources, tips, and tools to overcome challenges and continue creating in a changing landscape. Guidance on accounting for unpredictable costs: 1. Strategies to Mitigate Tariff Challenges As tariffs and production costs shift, there are various ways to incorporate these changes into your reward and/or shipping pricing. Here are some practical steps you can take to navigate these changes: Reward Tier Pricing If you‚Äôre in the pre-launch phase of your campaign, either in project build or have yet to hit that launch button, you can account for these changes by adjusting your reward pricing during campaign setup. To accurately recalculate costs for each tier, consider using tools likeUPS TradeAbilityto assess shipping complexities. Additionally, you can estimate tariff impacts by applying percentage increases based on resources such as theConference Board Tariff Tracker. By factoring in these estimates, you can set informed pricing for your rewards and ensure a successful campaign launch. UPS TradeAbility Conference Board Tariff Tracker Here is some additional guidanceon structuring your rewards by price.

Essential Tips for Building a Strong Community,"Backers are more than just supporters‚Äîthey‚Äôre an essential part of your project‚Äôs journey and success. Cultivating a dedicated community requires transparency, active engagement, and strategic communication to keep backers informed and excited. Here, we‚Äôve gathered essential tips and backer insights on how to build a thriving community for your project on Kickstarter. Provide Clear, Prioritized Project Updates Backers want to stay in the loop, but they also want updates that are quick and to the point. As projects progress, it‚Äôs important to deliver updates that summarize key changes and avoid overwhelming backers with excessive details. Backer Insight: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a TL;DR on project updates.‚Äù Another Perspective: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essential to highlight important messages‚Äîthings like new pledge options or post-campaign download links. We need to identify quickly what‚Äôs critical!‚Äù To make your updates clear and manageable: Start each update with a brief summary of what‚Äôs new or essential.Use labels or tags like ‚ÄúImportant‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew Reward Options‚Äù to signal priority.Avoid overloading backers with small, recurring updates, and focus on milestones or notable changes. Start each update with a brief summary of what‚Äôs new or essential. Use labels or tags like ‚ÄúImportant‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew Reward Options‚Äù to signal priority. Avoid overloading backers with small, recurring updates, and focus on milestones or notable changes. These simple adjustments can go a long way in ensuring backers feel informed without feeling buried under unnecessary information. Prioritize Consistent, Transparent Communication Consistency is key to maintaining trust. A recurring concern among Kickstarter backers is that creators sometimes fall silent, leading to uncertainty and frustration. Regular updates help reassure backers and build long-term loyalty. Backer Insight: ‚ÄúHonestly, the biggest annoyance is that creators regularly ghost their backers. Sometimes it will be 3-6 MONTHS between updates.‚Äù Another Perspective: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd appreciate a monthly update from each creator I back.‚Äù To foster trust and transparency: Schedule updates at least once a month to keep backers engaged.Even if progress is slow or you‚Äôre waiting on factors out of your control, a brief note can go a long way in maintaining confidence.Consider using updated templates that make it easy to communicate key information‚Äîlike timelines, milestones, and challenges. Schedule updates at least once a month to keep backers engaged. Even if progress is slow or you‚Äôre waiting on factors out of your control, a brief note can go a long way in maintaining confidence. Consider using updated templates that make it easy to communicate key information‚Äîlike timelines, milestones, and challenges. Backers understand that projects face challenges, but they appreciate knowing that they aren‚Äôt being left in the dark. Regular communication, even when there‚Äôs little new to report, demonstrates respect for the support they‚Äôve shown. Address Backer Concerns Promptly Active listening is a major part of community building. Backers often voice feedback, concerns, or suggestions that can be invaluable to the success of your project. By responding to these concerns, you‚Äôre not only strengthening your relationship with backers but also refining your approach. For instance, if a backer raises concerns about a shipping timeline, responding with an honest update on where things stand can prevent frustration and encourage patience. Backer Insight: ‚ÄúBetter easier status updates. It can be challenging and frustrating to determine current estimated shipping dates.‚Äù To address backer feedback effectively: Keep a close eye on comments and messages from backers.Respond promptly and publicly where possible to show transparency.Share specific steps you‚Äôre taking to address common concerns, whether it‚Äôs setting clearer shipping timelines or offering status reports.
